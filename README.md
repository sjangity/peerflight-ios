# peerflight-ios

### The Objective

Peerflight started as a webapp proof-of-concept on a custom PHP framework that I built.

It later supported a true, native ios client application with full-sync data. The purpose of the app was to help travelers find companions for an otherwise boring or long flight. Ignoring privacy issues aside (not that big a deal back then!), this was a brilliant concept. :-) By no means was there heavy market research or needfinding done as it was nothing more than a blip in the ideation phase and was more tech-heavy. The app allowed me to explore the complexities of native mobile integration within an existing web application.

> This was also during the days (2014ish) when people didn't know whether to write the MOBILE first or WEB first or something in between.

In hindsight, I think peerflight was drawn from the heavy painpoints in my days at Zynga where writing parity and conformity between client-functionality and server-functionality was only the start of the problems as mobile usage and the app-economy increased 10x overnight. This was of course in the early days before PWA and before Javascript became popular both on client and server.
